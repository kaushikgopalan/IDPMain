I had one of the most successful teams in the company ranking as the top store year over year in two separate markets; one in the Northeast one in the Southeast. I was a paragon winner with the company as well. My most recent DM was very supportive. I genuinely thank them for the opportunity and the knowledge that I acquired while working with them.","Work hours were excessive. To be successful hours worked were borderline slavery. While I willingly worked them to be successful; the week you didn't you were immediately behind. Vacations were almost non existent due to constant visitors from corporate stopping in to do reviews. Holiday weeks were paid 4 days regular 1 holiday and you worked all 5. The facade of the stores looking great when these people stop by versus the reality of the business is polarizing. There were always teams of people and excessive expenditures of payroll thrown into stores prior to their visits. While I understood the need to make an appearance; it was always will always be a backwards way off thinking. Company preaches quality of life for their clients while quality of life for their employees is non-existent. As a ""manager"" in your average store you will be ""managing"" a total of one person during your shift; with a total of 10 people at location.  Location open hours will exceed total payroll hours ie Sun-Sat 7am-10pm = 15hrs per day x 7 days x 2 people = 210 hrs which excludes the need to have a person unload deliveries that come in during non opened hours. Your budgeted hours will be approximately 208 hrs. I will only mention that during the month of December that there are extended hours for the stores but no budgeted hours to accommodate. Stores are held to strict shrink targets with little to no control over external theft. Remember 2 people at location; if four people enter to steal there is nothing you can do to stop them.

This is a GIGANTIC company and YMMV depending on your group. Keep that in mind when reading.    Anyway; I've been here only 6 months; but I think I have enough of a feel for Optum to write a review.    The positives:  Great work/life balance: I never have to stay late; work on weekends; etc. I get 23 vacation days and my manager encourages me to use them AND completely unplug while away.     Beautiful office: I work at the new Optum office in Eden Prairie. Building is modern and comfortable. Full size gym and locker room; and workout classes. Great parking ramp with a skyway so you never need to go outside in the rain or snow!    Work from home: VERY progressive with WFH! I can work from wherever I want. if I want to WFH one day; I can. If I want to WFH the whole week; I can do that; too. No one questions you.    Total autonomy    No drama: This is a very heads down place! I can't stress that enough. No one socializes with each other -- most of the time; you never even talk to your cube neighbors (because they're probably working from home). This is a positive for me though -- after working in some high drama offices; this is a refreshing change.     All meetings are over webex: Great news if you hate in-person meetings like I do -- because there are very few! In the 6 months I've been here; I've had 4 in person meetings. This is also a con because you never meet your coworkers - read the con list for more info.     30 minute ""best practice"" meeting times: You will not get invited to 2+ hour meetings; ever. Nearly all meetings are only 30 minutes. You might have the one-off meeting that's an hour; but it's rare.     Good; standardized PM practices. But some of the documentation requirements are too rigid and can slow progress down. Our group is trying to move to 100% agile. Slowly.... All of my projects so far have been waterfall SDLC. Although as a new person; it would help to have a PM to shadow on some of these documentation/audit practices. I've had to learn as I go.     - Great cafeteria with cheap prices. I can get a lunch here cheaper than I can bring it from home.    -Very engaging training classes!!! All training classes are over LearnSource (i.e. your computer) but the videos are well done and entertaining.","-Building seems empty because so many people WFH. It's almost kind of...sad. Such a nice building but no one is there.    -Internet explorer is the browser of choice. Yuck. You have to have special permissions to download Google Chrome or Firefox on your computer.    -If you like socializing with your coworkers; this is NOT a place for you! I can't stress that enough!! You will NOT meet your new BFF here. Everyone is very heads-down and focused on work -- no one chit chats about football or True Detective! You will not have coworkers stopping by your desk (to chat about a TV show OR to even chat about work). Most of my days; I don't talk to anyone in person. It's kind of depressing -- and I'm an introvert! There are no happy hours; social events outside of work; etc (this is a positive for me because I hate that stuff).    -Lots of contractors. Not that it's a bad thing - I've had great experiences with the PM contractors. They obviously don't last as long as the employees; and there's more contractor PMs than employee PMs.    -Difficult; as a new person; to know ""who's who."" There is no face-to-face meetings; so as a PM; it's tough to know who does what; since there's no face to put with the name. I struggle with this a lot; as I'm not used to this extreme of a ""remote"" workforce!     -No wifi for your phone. Wifi is only available for visitors and you must have a user name and password.     -Nearly all social media websites are blocked. Not really a con; but something you might want to know. You won't be browsing facebook at work!    -LOTS of meetings. Sure; the meetings aren't in person; they're over Webex; but you will have a LOT of them.    -Some ""know-it-all"" ego-driven coworkers; especially on the tech side. But this is typical of IT in general. I've witnessed this at every org in which I've worked.",4,"Steve Hemsley","President; CEO; and Director",1324,68,32

But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company.   1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days; doctor visits; etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact; and not by hours spent at their office.   2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately; many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business.   3. At least in my area; there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.","1. Unfortunately; IBM still uses the ""normal distribution"" rating system; where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%); above average contributor (15%); average contributor (~75%); and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world; where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours; and end up being ""average contributors"" at the end of the year; because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors.     2. The above may not be so disturbing; if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises; performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent ""above average"" rating in the last 4-5 years; and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated ""average contributor"" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.    From talking to manager friend; this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them; as part of its direction of reducing US manpower.     3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again; as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear; especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams.     4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future.  Employees learn from rumors and news websites what's about to come...",4,"Virginia Rometty",CEO,6015,52,48

The CEI department that handles FDOT inspections is still a growing department and consistantly brings work in even in spite of the Engineering and Surveying departments nearing zero workload.    There is a good close-knit group of employees in the various departments that have been with the company through thick and thin and they all seem like genuine people.  IT people do thier best to help with the limitations of the hardware.    The office environment is generally pretty loose and informal.","The company has slowly languished since the economic bust with no clear direction as how to keep afloat.  Top talent across the company started to leave; either by retirement or in the case of younger employees; by taking positions elsewhere.  With those departures the client list of the company shrank and with no clear business strategy no new clients were brought in and older clients were not retained.  Attempts to try to jump into new avenues of work with larger cleints or public sectors are unsucessful as the marketing aspects of the company do not lay the ground work for reaching goals.    Marketing has been generally haphazard without clear goals or direction.    Management does not believe in strengthening current loyal employees and instead brings in other subs on a regular basis at higher payrates than the employees.  Work weeks; benefits and salaries are being cut to allow that and many times the unhandled work load of the subs fall on the employees whom are never credited for thier roles.    Micro-managed ""billability"" models are strictly adhered to and are impossible to meet with the companies workload and expectations.  Management often doesn't agree on how employee times are spent.  Often an employee will get conflicting direction on how to handle a project budget.  Management will often hold numerous non-billable meetings in a week thereby making the billable percentage unattainable and then expect you to answer for your non-billable time the next week.    Management has been short-sighted on technology updates which is causing issues.  Most computers are still running Windows 2000.  AutoCAD is still only on 2004 and their Microstation is still on the 1995 version.  This is already having an affect on functionality and with the ageing server it is only a matter of time before large scale and expensive improvements will need to be made.",2,--,--,--,--,--

If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher.  401k match is nice.    3.  Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine.  This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work; you can have a stable job; pay your bills; feed your family; and not worry (too much) about layoffs.  The stock you own likely won't tank; but probably won't go up much either.  You'll get a bonus each year and some stock.  It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume:  After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90;000 employees; don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.    Managing Your Career:  Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90;000 employees work there.  Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company.

I took advantage of the continued education benefit and am finishing my masters degree now... I also joined a couple of the employee resource groups which offer seminars and networking events that support your professional profile. Listen; I'm not a total nerd. The point of my post is that this isn't a company you join and just stay stale within. They encourage your growth; but it's up to you to make it happen. Not only this - it's pretty exciting. We're busy and we have big jobs to do. My salary is in the top percentile for my industry but not only this; I again get the continued education (which is ~$6K/year) plus free cable/internet; top health care benefits and a truly balanced lifestyle - which is rarely the case within the Tech industry.","Telling people you work at Comcast triggers 2 typical responses: 1) A big hatred rant on customer service 2) A how do I get my foot in the door?

I personally think they should defend themselves a little more - they are between a rock and a hard place in many instances of service. I personally experienced visiting someone's home where the issues they were having with their connection was due to a tree root growing into the cable lines which had been their for over 20 years. Things like that cannot be diagnosed over a phone call. It's hard work in the field for sure.

I worked for a large consulting firm prior to joining UMT and while I had a successful career projection; I was attracted to the endless possibilities that UMT offers its consultants in terms of client projects; innovation and entrepreneurship.  There’s a saying that UMT is ‘small for the experience - big for the opportunities.’  I’ve found that UMT has a family-friendly culture with a close network of bright colleagues and yet works for several of the largest companies in the world in multiple industries.  UMT’s corporate structure has an agility to it that lends itself to being able to recognize and reward hard work and excellence quickly; which other firms have a difficult time competing with.  I have always wanted to work for a company that truly challenged me to reach my potential – at UMT I was given a lot of responsibility from the start but was also equipped with great resources to assist me in tackling the learning curve.  To me; this is the perfect environment to challenge yourself to think outside the box; be resourceful and see what you can achieve.  New ideas are respected and considered which fosters a true sense of teamwork as everyone has the opportunity to add value to the firm.  Having worked in consulting for almost a decade now; I can honestly say that I have not come across a better firm to work for than UMT.","As the firm is in a significant growth phase right now; there are some growing pains as the leadership team manages the growth in client accounts as well as workforce.

It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing; but it's still very engineer-focused).  * The perks are amazing. Yes; free breakfast; lunch; an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria; NY Public Library; MoMA; etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.  * Speaking of which; the company is doing quite well; which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.  * There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis); to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world; to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising; there's really something for everybody.  * It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).  * The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food; beer; wine; etc. is served; a new project is presented; and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything; no matter how controversial; and frequently the executives will be responsive.  * No; nobody cares if you use an iPhone; Facebook; shop with Amazon; stream using Spotify; or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.    Neither pro nor con; but general information on work-life balance; promotions; and advancement.  * Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected; you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible; and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it; or because they're competitive; or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra; you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter; so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.  * If you excel and work your butt off; you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey; and just sit coding with your head down all day; you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure; if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable; you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average; but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done; and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement); but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead; so this isn't actually _that_ hard; so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger; and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy; slow to respond to market threats; bloated teams; cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).  * The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping; but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics; because as the absolute number of people grows; naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was; but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.  * Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again; because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined; etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks; which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place; but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",5,"Sundar Pichai",CEO,75,96,4

The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however; the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact; the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.    The company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits; 401k match; RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry; they are above market and pretty competitive.","Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle; slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful; you will live; sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong; this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.    If you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on; give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands; reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.    While Cisco attracts some bright; motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs; which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs.",4,"Chuck Robbins",CEO,607,93,7

Most people think highly about this company because it has been apart of many high profile m&a and ipo deals and is known for its extensive recruiting practices and hardworking culture.  So having this brand on your resume will convey many positive qualities to recruiters.  If you get an offer here; definitely take it.  Once hire; if you do not enjoy working here; stick it out for a few years and then start your search again.","Goldman Sachs experiences very high turnover and many people; on average; stay with the company for 2-4 years.  For example; in my department; in one year; about 5 employees left for other companies.  Our department only had 30 people so it was a huge brain drain for us.  When I asked my former colleagues on why they left; many of them cited the long hours.  Some would work over 80 hours a week and other for over 11 hour days.  They said they were unable to see their kids grow up or had healthy issues related to the long work weeks. So know that these long hours aren't for every lifestyle.

Good 401K matching (they'll contribute a max of 3% of your 6% or greater). Free drinks in the breakroom. Flexibility to work from home at times. (If you live 50+ miles away from an office you can work full-time from home...policy).","They don't try to make the workplace anything special (maybe a pool table and arcade game are cliche or gimmicky?). In the 10 years I've worked there; they've given 2 measly %1 cost of living raises (this is the same with most everyone I've spoken to; some don't get any raises). You will not get a substantial raise ever; unless you leave then get rehired on (they will not match offers; better to leave). New employees that you train will make 10 - 20K more than you several years after you hire on (not just me; they do this to all tenured employees). They will give these untrained; less experienced people higher titles (again this is done to everyone not just me). You learn pretty quickly that you're dispensable. The company has billions in cash and they don't re-invest in their employees; just in acquiring new companies and hiring new people that know nothing that you get to train.",4,"Safra A.

Older workers may not feel the same about the 401k or Health package.   Usually very busy during the day at any of the stores. Nights tend to slow down and is the only time for a service supervisor to get any work done away from the front end.  For the most part; co-workers are decent. Other locations may vary; but for the most part Hornbacher's tries to foster positive teamwork and professionalism in its stores. Turnover is high considering this line of work is considered entry level. And of course there are several employees that are really not motivated. Management tries its best to weed out the undesirables by moving them around departments until they find the right line of work for the lazy or non motivated.","Sub par pay scales as mentioned in most of the reviews. Raises for most full time employees is one notch above insulting. Part time employees actually have a chance to move up the pay scale at a quicker pace than most full timers.  As mentioned in other reviews; upper level management is always out of touch with the average morale of the workplace; especially considering the recent work shortages in the Fargo-Moorhead area. Workers are expected to do a whole lot more with a whole lot less.  As mentioned by another service supervisor ""Training"" is a complete joke. Being fed to the wolves would be an understatement when it comes to how fast ""training"" is done. Many problems could be solved simply by listening to us small folk that try to keep the stores running smoothly.  Job specific - Service supervisors work a different schedule every week.There is no thing such as a fixed schedule for managing the front end. Weekends are almost always a must; at least at my location. You get two days off a week; but the schedule is never fixed and it is hard to work around the schedule to get a single weekend off.   One last thing... Customers can be very demanding and narcissistic. Sometimes the pay doesn't even begin to make up for the verbal vomit we hear on an almost daily basis.
