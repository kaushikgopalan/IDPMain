badoo,organizations/badoo,organization/badoo,Badoo,,"Badoo is a social networking site focused on dating, allowing users to chat, make friends and share interests.","Badoo.com makes it fun to connect with new people locally to chat, meet-up or make new friends. Badoo has currently just over 201 million registered members. If Badoo was a country it would have surpassed the combined population of the United Kingdom, France and Italy some time ago.

Badoo’s fastest growth has been among young adults aged between 25 and 35 years old. These young adults are looking to make new friends, rather than connecting with relatives and colleagues on other social networks. The number of registered users has increased by 28% during 2013, and Badoo is currently growing by 100,000 new users every day.

As a freemium social network we offer a wide range of free services, plus paid special features to help you meet even more new people.

Badoo was launched in 2006, and is now one of the leading social networks in Europe and South America. We have 200 million users, with over 100,000 new sign-ups every day. People use Badoo to find new friends in 191 countries and 44 languages. Badoo has 250 employees and is based in London, with offices in Moscow and San Francisco. For more information please visit www.badoo.com.

The engine driving Badoo is the location-based hot-or-not game, called Encounters, launched in 2007. Encounters allows users to find people in their local area, with the help of photo, interests and profile info. A match is created when both users like each others’ profiles. Every day users visit 563 million profiles resulting in close to 10 million daily matches. 

The double opt-in, requiring both partners to express interest, avoids users getting messages from people they don’t like, and takes away the feeling of rejection you might feel in a bar or dating site. Alternatively, using the People Nearby feature, users can browse and filter people based on location, interests and age. It's easy to find new people you like, send them a message, and then buy them a virtual gift or start a chat.
